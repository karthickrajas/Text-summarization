Have you seen how much Ranch 99 is trying to charge!!,,"I bought this 6 pack because for the price that my local Ranch 99 was trying to charge, I could buy 3 through Amazon.  Product is identical and managed to save tons of money on sauce I use on everything."
Love this stuff,,"We use it on fish sticks, chicken, burgers, meatloaf, rice, etc.  It's similar to country bob sauce, but a little sweeter."
There are better gluten-free breads...,,This bread is very dry and crumbly compared to the other major brand. Will definitely not be switching from my usual brand (without the 'R').
"Good value, not as flavorful as some",,"We always drink the vanilla flavored coffee so I've gotten to know quite a few brands.  This one is good, but not the best (that's why I rated it 4 stars)."
"Vanilla Nut, Organic Whole Bean Coffee",,"I like the flavor, but it is very weak for me. I am not really a person who likes really strong coffee, but this is just very weak coffee."
Getting harder to find,,"These were perfect, and a brand I am familiar with. Now I have a good source for them."
Good,,"Great tasting buttery beans in huge packages.  I enjoyed them.  I didn't follow the instructions exactly, but just made them as I normally make beans and they came out great."
Add Ham Hock for a feast,,These beans are just about perfection.  They are firm yet tender and the flavor is exactly right.  The large packages are easy to store and make a great addition to lots of meals.  Thanks for a nearly perfect product.
Disappointed,,"I bought these beans hoping they would be good quality, but I was disappointed upon opening the package to see how many broken beans there were and how much dust was at the bottom of each bag.<br /><br />Those which weren't split in the bag came apart during the soaking.  This means my cooked beans will look even worse<br /><br />I am used to Greek 'giant limas', which soak to become huge and remain whole in the process. Now I've got a huge quantity of a product I don't want.<br /><br />I was annoyed to see that Amazon will not accept returns for food products, because I think this is really inferior quality."
SUPERB!,,"Ordinarily, you have to pick through packages of lima beans and sort out the chipped, split and discolored ones.  Not so with these ivory colored limas, all perfectly formed and unblemished.  All you have to do is rinse.<br /><br />I didn't soak them overnight as per instructed.  Just soaked them in hot water for an hour, rinsed, and then cooked until done.  They worked out fine and they make a very smooth, tasty bean.<br /><br />There is a most interesting recipe on the packets called ""Cool Lima Beans and Couscous Salad"" which I can't wait to make.  It requires olive oil, sherry vinegar, ground cumin, red and green bell peppers and other ingredients.  The couscous they recommend is Golden.  Bob's Red Mill also has this product.  Yum!<br /><br />These beans are natural and, of course, they are large.  I'm going to make them a permanent staple in my home."
"Great buy, smooth, clean beans, no picking over :-)",,"This are the nicest dry large limas I have ever seen. Definitely keeping them on subscription. The bags are big enough I get two pots of beans from each bag. The beans are clean and smooth, not broken up or dirty, I didn't have to pick them over at all. Made a delicious pot of bean soup with ham bone, onions garlic a little diced bacon, diced carrots, a little salt and water to cover. Didn't even have to soak the beans and the soup was done in about 90 min, thick, creamy and delicious. Not a bite was left. Highly recommend these! Nicer than any I've ever bought in the grocery store."
"Excellent Beans, Of Course~",,"These large Lima Beans cook up perfectly every time.  I've already made two pots of them since Friday.  Hearty and filling, these clean beans pack a nutritious (protein 'n' fiber) punch whenever we enjoy them.  I'm glad that they're already on our  ""Subscribe & Save"" lists, so that we won't ever run out.  De-lish!"
Nice beans,,"I was making the ""Marinated Gigante Bean Salad with Shrimp"" from Gwyneth Paltrow's Cookbook (""My Father's Daughter"") and needed some large, white beans.  I wanted to use the Gigante Beans from Navarro, but they're a bit pricey for a small jar.  (I'll use those occasionally.)  I found these as a nice alternative and I don't think I've ever seen them in stores??  I noticed someone said they're getting harder to find, so I'm glad to have gotten the bulk size.  They worked out just fine in the recipe (quite good, in fact) and if I'm missing something by not getting the special beans from Navarro, from our local Spanish food specialty shop, I don't know it."
Now THIS is some serious coffee !!,,"Very impressed coffee junkie here. What coffee should be, but seldom is. Beautiful, dark oily beans with a grand aroma. Roasted perfectly. NO burned beans - (unlike the leading brand :O). The sealed can kept them very fresh. Brews a great cup with a buzz-producing caffeine content. Best coffee I have had in years. Will be buying again."
Good but Kicking Horse Kick Ass is better,,This a good bold coffee. However I found the taste of the Kicking Horse Kick Ass to be the best bold coffee.<br />I use a Breville burr grinder to grind my beans. The Kick Ass beans are more oily than 454.
"Surprisingly Good, Even if You Aren't a Caffeine Addict",,"I bought Kicking Horse 454 Horsepower coffee for my mother after reading the reviews on Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  She's a hard woman to shop for, with few hobbies but an endless capacity for drinking coffee, not quite mechanically-advanced enough to roast her own, but a coffee snob for sure.  When my mom opened up the gift bag with these tins of coffee, she popped the lid on one and stuck her nose in, inhaled deeply and immediately left the room to brew a pot.  This was a Christmas morning gift; she literally brought our gift-opening to a complete halt because she wanted a cup of the Kicking Horse coffee instead of what had already been brewed.  It was a well-received gift, to say the least.<br /><br />Dark, oily, velvety and rich beans produce a cup with the same quality.  My mother was in whole bean coffee heaven and the whole house filled with the intense aroma.  I'm a coffee drinker too, though compared with my mother that's sort of like looking at the Titanic, flipping your kayak, and saying you've had a boating accident too.  Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised to find the brew palatable to me.  Many of her dark roasts either taste too bitter in my mouth, or wind up upsetting my stomach; I didn't have either problem with Kicking Horse.<br /><br />I highly recommend Kicking Horse Coffee.  With my mother's birthday on the horizon, at least I now know to give her the coffee at the very end of the party!"
serious coffee for serious coffee lovers,,a strong and smooth coffee. one of the darkest that kicking horse delivers. we use it in our espresso machine. nothing else compares for a strong but NOT bitter latte. we've tried tons and always come back to this one. highly recommended.
Coffee Lover - Must try,,"If you love dark, oily coffee beans that create a rich, robust cup of coffee, you will love Kicking Horse. I was introduced to it by Canadian friends of mine when they gave it to me as a gift.<br />Well, it took the first pot that we made to know that this was a keeper. The flavor is wonderful - dark and intense but not so much that it has no taste. Some of the dark roast coffees that we have tried have very little taste.<br />I am ordering this on a regular basis now from Amazon, of course."
Better than Kick A$$ Dark,,"I've been taste-testing a few different coffees on Amazon: this one, Kicking Horse's Kick A$$ Dark, and several of Raven's Brews.  This one has the best flavor so far for my taste: strong, rich, smoky, and low acid.  Not super complex, maybe very slight hints of chocolate, but no off flavors or unpleasant background or aftertaste.  This roast is stronger and darker than the KickA$$."
Great way to start the morning!,,"Purchased for the boyfriend and he says it is very, very good. The beans have a nice sheen to them and are a bit larger. He likes the re-sealable cans and will re-use them. These really make great gifts and I highly recommend them for your coffee snob friends. You won't be disappointed!"
454 Horsepower for the body.,,"Description:<br />- It comes in a large tin can, the lid is more a cap that comes on and off without twisting.<br />- It is a conversation starter when someone comes in and notices that this coffee contains 454 Horsepower.<br /><br />Impression:<br />- 454 Horsepower is a coffee that is rich in flavor and boldness without any of the bitterness of other roasts.<br />- It contains enough caffeine to wake me up and keep me going.<br />(A college student that has shamelessly embraced coffee as a breakfast item.)<br />- Great when mixed with milk, the flavor of the coffee stays.<br />- No cons in mind, it is my kind of coffee that contains the caffeine and flavor without the acidity and bitterness."
"Best coffee you'll ever have... Starbucks, move over!",,Discovered this coffee while visiting in Canada. It's available in the larger grocery stores.  Can't get it here in TN so we subscribe via Amazon & get our 4 pounds every 2 weeks.  It comes out to $0.63/once - not a bad deal!
Tasty coffee,,"A good, strong, but not bitter blend.  Might be a bit strong for some, but they have other varieties that are not quite as robust."
"All the Kicking Horse coffees are great, but",,"Been drinking ALL the Kicking Horse coffees exclusively since we visited British Columbia three years ago. The 454 was the first I tried, and it was love at first drink. It's still my favorite. It's a very strong coffee. None of the coffees give me heartburn like that extremely popular Star[something] does. I use the Krups grind and brew system on ""strong"" and I wake up looking for the ""ON"" button. If you like less strong coffee, try the ""Hoodoo Jo"".<br />Glad I can save $$ through Amazon now."
A stout cup of coffee! Oh Yeah!,,"I like the Kicking Horse brand of coffees and Three Sisters is my usual all-day choice. There comes a time when one needs a bit more power to start the day and 454 Horse Power totally punches the starter! The full body & flavor with low acidity is true. There is no ""burnt sox"" smell to these beans. Its a dark and rich blend with excellent flavor. I have tried several cans of the Kick Ass Dark with no complaints but no real bonding either. The 454 Horse Power Dark is perfect for when a richer, darker, brew with ""wake-up!!"" powers is needed! The beans are nicely dark-roasted & fresh. My 454HP is med coarse ground as needed and done in a french press - yes, I want all the oils & flavors possible! It should provide serious espresso too. Normally, I don't use added condiments to my coffee, but 454HP will be fine for those wanting sugar or cream. I've placed 454HP into subscription!"
Delicious Coffee,,"I ordered this coffee based on all the positive reviews.  I was looking for a robust roast that would work well in a French press, which I started using about a year ago.  I have tried many different sourced beans and blends and grind them coarse in a burr grinder.  I have a few favorites, but I can't always travel to the stores that carry them.  Finding this particular coffee on Amazon was great!  It is the robust but smooth brew I was looking for.  That it is shade grown and fair trade is a major plus, as I will always search those out as a responsible consumer.  I will be ordering this again and again."
LOVE IT!!!,,I really love the darkness of this coffee. It is well balanced but still packs a good punch. I'm hoping Amazon starts selling it in the 2.2lb bags soon since I already have a ton of the empty canisters and would like to refill and reuse them.
"Smokey, but not what I'd hoped.",,"I ordered based on the reviews, and while it is better than the likes of most coffees, I'm not really impressed.  I think I'll try Kick Ass next.  Being this coffee is at the highest roast temp, I assumed it would be very smokey, but I find that the Diedrich French Roast is more smokey and more smooth.  The beans did not seem as dark as I expected them to be.  They look more of a typical dark roast, below a French or Italian roast.  Who knows, maybe I'll like Kick Ass better.  And BTW, Diedrich is much cheaper ($9 for 12 oz)."
dark but not burnt,,"This is good stuff. Powerful, dense, a little syrupy feel.  I save it for weekends when there's time to enjoy it."
Kicking horse coffe,,We bought this coffee took it in the motorhome on our vacation.. the very best wake up coffee every day.!!!!
Fantastic Robust Flavor,,"This is my new fav - great flavor, no acid, just great. I love how it comes in its own containers also - good buy"
"strong, smokey and flavorful",,"I love coffee. For years I've roasted my own green beans (purchased via internet). I used an espresso mix which I liked. Lately, I think the mix has changed, so I started looking around for a replacement. I tried 5 different espresso blends from Sweet Maria's; Starbucks dark espresso roast; and green beans from Whole Foods (where I once had the best espreso ever, but haven't been able to duplicate). This 454 Horse Power is whole bean, dark oily roasted, and powerful. It will cut through any milk or cocoa mix. If you like your lattes creamy and light, don't buy this. If you want something that will kick your taste buds into submission, then this is for you. The tin it comes in is nice."
It Kicks Ass,,"I love this coffee!  Had it first in Canada and checked on Amazon when I got back home.  I get monthly whole bean delivery.<br />Have tried a few of the Kicking Horse blends and it's always satisfying .  Full, dark and delicious.  Never acidic.  Always good taste."
"Seriously, the BEST coffee around!",,"Do I really need to say more than what my title says? This coffee seriously is the best coffee I have ever used in the French Press, I am now hooked on it and will not buy another brand.  It is bold and dark, not bitter at all. My husband and I could never agree onn a coffee because he likes his coffee really dark, but I never liked dark coffee as it was too bitter. We have found a coffee we agree on!"
power coffee,,Kick ass and horse power dark. The best coffee ever.  for people who like a really strong cup of coffee. This is my favorate coffee...and the only coffee that i will drink. yummy///
"If you like your coffee black, then this is the coffee for you.",,"I only like my coffee black, iced or hot. I've tried many coffees. This one delivers the ""kick"" I need with the taste I want. Not bitter at all, just smooth and strong."
"I usually hate kicking a dead horse, BUT!!",,I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality and great taste of this dark roasted coffee blend.<br />For coffee at any price this blend delivers a nice body and smooth but bold tase.<br />The name says it all.
coffee,,I was told by my son best coffee he has tried He is a expert on coffee.I just can`t seem to be able to have enough in my pantry before I run out before ordering again
Best Coffee,,"Had this coffee for the first time about 3 years ago while visiting Canada and have been hooked ever since - bought several bags, put them in the freezer (I know - bad) and have been starting to get depressed watching my stash disappear.  On my last bag now and went to look today to see if I can order online and am so happy I can order 454 Horse Power from Amazon!!!  Whoo Hoo!!  I like my coffee a little strong and with some cream or milk and a little raw sugar - the best coffee ever!"
BEST COFFEE,,"If you want a strong cup of coffee, this is the blend for you.  I have this sent by automatic delivery as I really don't want to run out of this coffee.  I can be kind of grumpy when I do.  The flavor is superb, not bitter."
The dark roast I have been searching for,,"This is my new dark roast. It has the bold flavor I have been looking for, without any burnt flavor or bitter aftertaste. As dark and strong as it is, it is amazingly smooth. Hats off to Kicking Horse crew for the quality of this roast.<br />I make this in a standard drip coffee pot in the morning as well as French press when I'm not fumbling around in the morning like a fool. Using a French press definitely wins out in the war of full flavored, but it very much impresses with standard drip.<br />I shared some with co-workers the other day, and I think they understand why I am slowly becoming an idiot coffee snob."
Great Coffee,,"I bought all 3 kinds of Kicking Horse coffee and this one, 454 Horse Power, was my favorite. Beans were moist and produced a great flavor. I just wished they offered this type in the 2.2 lb bags. FYI Nice tins though."
That hits the spot!,,"I just finished up my first large cup of 454 and was blown away!  Man... this is good stuff.  My wife also commented about how tasty it was... ""very very tasty"" I believe were her exact words.  I can only hope the next cup continues to impress.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who likes to 'pour a little coffee' into their milk and sugar it might not be for you.  It's strong enough to clean your socks while wearing them!<br /><br />I think I'll get that second cup right now...."
KH 454,,"This is a great product if you like strong coffee.  I like the flavor too.  I first bought it at Cost Plus about six months ago.  Ever since, It's been my favorite.  And I drink a lot of coffee."
It's Ok,,"I was moved to try this coffee because of other reviews I had read while coffee shopping. I wanted to try something different, as I regularly switch brands. Bottom line, it's just OK. I not bad but it's not great either. I was expecting something called Kicking Horse coffee to be a pretty bold cup o'mud, but alas, it was just kinda... well... ok. It comes in nice tins though."
454 degrees of good,,"Dark,rich and roasty but never bitter,my favorite coffee ever.Also,they support alot of good things such as fair trade,organic and sustainable farming practices."
Yummy!,,These beans have flavor and depth.  I loved every cupful.  When you first open the can you can smell the cocoa undertones.  These beans were well roasted.
Great stuff,,"The ordering process is quite simple.  Prime shipping is great.  So, I saw the coffee and the name sounded intriguing, so I placed an order for it.  Can't be happier.  The coffee is very good."
Worth the money. Refreshing change.,,"This was a tad  bit spendy, but worth it for the change of pace. My only quibble is that it took an extra day or two to arrive. I think it's a Canadian product??? Anyway, fun name, smooth rich cup, nice finish."
mmmm...,,"Very tasty. Not the biggest coffee nut in the world, but this was a great addition to our coffee mess in the office. I'll probably re-review this after experiencing other tasty treats in the coffee world."
Dosen't always taste or grind the same.,,It's really good when ground right but I just make this ocassionally and most often use nes cafe dolce gusto.
Lack of Flavor,,"This review has nothing to do with the suppliers, instead it has to do with the product. I didn't enjoy the texture of the outside part of the cake nor was there much difference in the taste between the fillings, an exception was the matcha. I have spent a good portion of my life eating Asian deserts particularly living near Chinatown in New York City. I understand that this is a Japanese assortment, but I believe the fillings lacked flavor, in particular the red bean. I adore red bean, chestnut and taro (taro wasn't included in the assortment but just saying), and so while the product was fresh and delivered on time. The quality wasn't there."
yummy,,These are really good I tried one of each.  I'm not sure which is which but they all taste similar
yummy,,these chips are so good. i found that these chips are hard to come by here in afghanistan but this company was able to mail these here to me. awesome.
I Highly recommended.,,"I Highly recommended."". Hei, customer!! If you like fragmentatized chips, this is the product for you. If you like to eat chips with a small spoon? You can not miss any of those."
baby food expires soon,,"Earth's best organic food are wonderful if you're on the go and didn't have time to make your baby's food.<br /><br />The food that was shipped expires in two months! Since it was a good price, I thought I would stock up. If I knew this, I would not have purchased it!  The baby food that i purchased last week at our local Whole Foods Market expires in two years.<br /><br />Now i'm stuck with 48 jars of pears that will expire in two months."
EB Pears,,"Earth's Best makes good baby food that my child likes. However, I am rating their product here as it is available through Amazon. I'm very disappointed, like the other reviewer said, about the very short expiration date.<br /><br />A few days before I ordered this, the page said it wasn't in stock and that it would be available Sept. 15th. I ordered on the 15th, and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2-day shipping. My case was supposedly the restocked pears, but the expiration date is Nov 09. New stock shouldn't have an expiration date that is only 2 months away, even if it is on sale! In the grocery store, the expiration date usually is 1 or 2 years away."
Son's Favorite,,"Earth's Best Pears are our son's favorite of the EB fruits.  He has significant feeding delays due to complications as a micro-preemie, but he's always done well with the pears.<br /><br />We have ordered several cases of the pears from Amazon and have had no problems with expiration dates.  All cases have had expiration dates many months from the purchase date."
babies love this!,,"I have two 8 mo old twins. The only way they will eat oatmeal is in combination with EB's pear. Very convenient, especially for quickly mixing their breakfast in the morning. Packaging from Amazon is always very secure, never any broken jars. Recommended."
Baby's favorite,,These pears are delicious.  My daughter enjoys them alone or mixed with oatmeal.  Good texture and mild flavor.  It transitioned her well to solid pears!
Product great but not shipped well,,"The product itself is great.  However, it arrived with some of the jars broken and pear everywhere.  It was a mess!  It definitely needs better packaging before it is shipped."
Organic and Tasty,,I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
Delicious.,,I love land of lakes cocoa.  I recommend making it with milk-it brings out the flavors even more. Worth every cent.
Rich and tasty,,This is a great deal because my local big box store with LOW prices sells a packet of this cocoa for .99 each.  My favorite flavors are all here.  I love how this has powdered milk built into the ingredients so that this cocoa does not *have* to be made with poured milk in order to taste extra rich.  Generally I just make this with boiling water.  Their taste is superior than the average grocery store hot cocoa offerings.  These are a real treat and taste like hot cocoa from a coffeehouse.
Really wonderful hot chocolate,,I love this brand hot chocolate.  It's very rich and wonderfully tasty.  My favorite is the chocolate supreme but they're all really very good!
Enjoyed the variety,,"Another present for Christmas for a hot cocoa fan. The variety of this package is great and didn't last long once he tucked into it. A little expensive, but worth it for the quality as a present."
Land O' Lakes Cocoa,,"This is a favorite of mine for more than 12 years. Absolutely yummy! I recommend the Chocolatemint, chocolate graham and chocolate raspberry flavors. Makes a greatly appreciated gift too!"
"wonderful product, great service",,I am very pleased with this product.  It was a quick and easy transaction.  Will be a repeat customer.  Amazon is a great site.
don't bother,,"i'll start of by saying that i LOVE the Golden (Vanilla) Oreos and the original Oreos. so, i thought i would try these. best of both worlds, right? WRONG. first off, they are not double-stuffed. it just looks like there's more icing than usual because they've made the cookies thinner. secondly, the vanilla cookie part does not taste like the Golden Oreos. it virtually has no flavor at all. thirdly, the texture of the cookie is really weird. it's very hard and crunchy and just plain gross."
Addicting!,,"I'm one of those people that doesn't like things that are ""too"" chocolaty. If I ever had an Oreo, I would remove one side and just eat the side with the stuffing. I like chocolate chip cookies but with fewer chips than most people prefer. These cookies have just the right amount of chocolate & vanilla for me. I am addicted.  Now if they came out with a chocolate chip cookie that has ""fewer"" chips, I'm really gonna be in trouble!"
Tasty,,So I bought this for a party. I got rave reviews. It's not too sweet or syrupy like a lot of margarita mixes. I would buy it again.
YUM!,,"I really like this margarita mix.  Not too sweet, no refined sugar, just right!  All it needs is a good quality tequila like 1800 or Patron!  Definitely will buy this again!"
Yummy!,,"I've been on a mission for a ""not too sweet"" margarita mix. Local stores here only carry the major brands: Jose Cuervo, Margaritaville, Mr & Mrs T, etc.  All of those taste like pure sugar and chemicals.  I tasted this on its own and was worried...  But, when mixing with good tequila, it was just right.  I'm very pleased.  Will buy again.  Note that this comes in a bottle, just like other mixers.  I was not clear on that based on the item picture above.  I thought maybe it would be a dry powder mix because the picture only shows the brand sticker."
Tasty Alternative,,"This brand of chips has been my favorite since I found them down in Pennsylvania when I used to travel that way.  A few years ago they started to sell them in New England and I was thrilled!  I've been buying them weekly since they made there appearance.<br /><br />But now I found I have entered those years were I have to watch my salt intake and the first thing to go was my beloved chips.  I have been depressed.  UNTIL I found quit by accident via Amazon that Herr's makes a lower salt chip.  And it is delicious.  I have been buying  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052Y7YL2"">Lay's Lightly Salted Potato Chips 10 oz</a> and while they are good, they are not GREAT like Herr's.  The Lay's taste and appearance can be inconsistent, you may find overly greasy chips one day and  unsalted ones the next.  And you never find those good slightly browned ones.<br /><br /> Herr's is consistently tasty, has some browner ones mixed in and you may even find some with skin on the edge of the chips. They are truly delicious and to be able to get them from the comfort of my home while still in my PJ's isd a treat.  And these chips are a treat I can't pass up."
Regatta Diet Ginger Beer has an aftertaste,,"Hi, this would be better if it was not as sweet with such an aftertaste, it tastes like saccharin and is a bit overpowering."
Guilt Free Dark and Stormy,,"A great summer drink just got better!  Though not quite as frisky as the original, this makes a terrifically refreshing summer drink . . . . hard to stop at one however."
Yummy,,These are the best crackers I have ever eaten!  They have a very unique taste and can be habit forming!
"Tortillas by Porkyland 10""",,The product was delivered in a timely manner. The tortillas have a good bread taste and the color is just slightly off white. It isn't quite like the ones I used to get in the store but it is a good product.
Love These and Will Happily Order Them Again!,,"I bought these in bulk to make vegan burritos for Occupy Philly. They are wonderful, basic flour tortillas.  I will order them again soon, as cooking in bulk for my family is also a necessity."
Simply great,,"Products such as this are becoming hard to find where I live. Emerald products are among the best, these are so good that I don't even want to try different ones. They are regular sized seeds, well roasted, and the ziploc type resealable bag is a plus. Not a lot more to say besides that."
"A Pleasant Surprise! Great Snack for ""Healthy Eating""",,"I ordered these not knowing what to expect and a little intimidated by a box of 12! I gave away 3 bags, but not the next time.<br /><br />I was browsing Amazon looking for Unsalted, but not raw, nuts.<br />I was thinking Almonds,or mixed which I have ordered before. Found these. AHA! Took a chance based on someone's recommendation of the Brand. Emerald has tasty products.<br /><br />I am eating them as I sit here typing.  They are excellent! Great roasted flavor. Great snack. Have not put into salad.<br />You could do that. I am on a diet, and needed a healthy substitute for the unhealthy crunchy foods-read carbs-I eat.<br />This helps a lot! The re-sealable bag is a handy size. Plus, you<br />get 5g. of Protein.<br /><br />The only negative-I am single-You have to buy 12 at a time."
Smell and taste outdated,,Received the package in 2 days which was good; gladly opened one pack and very disappointedly found out it both smelled and tasted like outdated.  I also realized the item is not returnable which is double the disappointment..  this was the last time buying the product.
GREAT NUTRITIOUS SNACK!,,"THOSE OF US, WHO WISH TO BE HEALTHY, WILL SURELY ENJOY THESE DELICIOUS SUNFLOWER SEEDS.  I ENJOY SOME, EVERYDAY, ALONE, IN CEREAL, IN SALADS, EVEN SPRINKLED ON ICE CREAM.  NEXT TIME, THOUGH, I'D LIKE TO TRY THE SALT-FREE ONES."
Good deal and YUMMY!,,"I bought these mints and found them small and tasty, very easy to share.  Everyone came visit us likes them, young and old."
Not Challenging -- Too Easy for Most Dogs,,"Sorry I bought this -- my terrier mix was not challenged in the least.<br /><br />It is a good idea, and I liked that it provides the opportunity for three different games because I thought the variety would be a plus, but all three games are too easy.<br /><br />The basic problem is that for two of the games -- the two where the treat is uncovered by sliding a piece -- the sliding pieces are so easily displaced that they pose no challenge.  The slightest touch makes them slide.<br /><br />The remaining problem is that the third game -- the one in which the covers have to be lifted -- requires the dog to do nothing more than what a dog does naturally:  pick up something with its mouth.  No biggie.<br /><br />I can see how this toy would be valuable to an extremely old, arthritic dog, who would appreciate the minimal effort needed to attain a treat.  Other than that, I think it is a waste of money.  An average dog would be unchallenged and a smart dog would be positively bored."
Way too easy,,The toy is sturdy and well constructed but my Havanese puppy took no time at all to figure out the three games.  Certainly not a brain teaser.  Because there are small pieces the owner must be involved in the game to be sure a puppy doesn't eat them.  My dog much prefers the ball with treats inside that fall out as he noses it around and so do I as it keeps him independently amused for at least 15 minutes.
Too easy!,,This was way too easy for my dogs. I have dog that is super smart and I knew he'd get it quickly but I bought it for my other dog that is a bit slower. Unfortunately he figured it out way to fast as well. =(
This product gets five barks!,,"My dog loved this worthwhile dog game!<br />There is three ways to set it up so the dog doesn't get bored of it.<br />Some are easy, but others are hard, allowing her to build confidence and get better at it before moving onto a harder version of the game.<br />I'd feel bad my dog was bored when I'd be busy, but now I can feel good knowing she's occupied when I'm away from home.<br />Great to set up and then leave the house so my dog doesn't try to run out the door to follow me since shes so busy figuring out the game.<br />It's so much fun and laughter to watch the dog and you feel proud when she figures out how to get the treats!<br />Put any treats inside, even peanut butter!<br />Can help with separation anxiety and excessive chewing.<br />Just think if you were home alone, you'd be bored, so think about how your dog feels when you're away, and get him this game!"
Fun game for dogs,,My 5 month old aussie/border collie mix puppy liked this game a lot. It's pretty durable. You hide the treats in the cups and your pup has to find them. I think the best part about this game is that it is 3 games in 1. Some of the games were easier for him to understand how to play quicker than others. My puppy was able to learn all 3 of the games pretty quickly. The instructions and set up are simple. I wish there were more of the green cups though. One more note i got mine from CVS for 13$ and change...but that was the first time i have seen a dog game sold in mainstream stores so buying online form amazon might be a good option if you dont feel like store hopping to try to find it. Overall i am happy with my purchase and love the idea of playing games with my puppy!
He loves it!,,"This is a great product. It has three different puzzles and it is really easy to switch from one puzzle to another. My dog gets so excited when we put treats in, he loves a challenge and it is very sturdy."
Love it,,"I don't know why people with larger dogs are complaining its not challenging enough. On their website and YouTube video it states it's intended for small to medium breeds, AND it's for owner and dog to play together, it's not like a kong that's you leave them with it and go out and expect your dog to be busy for hours.<br /><br />I personally loved it and so did my dog. I have a Maltese, and she's really smart so she can get the treats in less than 1 minute, but she still can't get it as fast as a large breed because they have huge snouts and easily knock down the cups.<br />I use the game as a reward, after we come home from training or a walk, I take out the game and she gets excited, and I get down on the floor to play with her. It's just a way of rewarding her and also practicing training, because I have her sit and wait while i put treats in it again, then I tell her ""ok"" and she goes to get them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-it's built really steardy<br />-it's easy to clean, way better than the wood ones<br />-it has four little suction cups at the bottom so it doesn't move around<br />-it's 3 different games for basically the price of one!<br />-fast shipping<br />-a great bonding experience and offers the dog something to look forward to after doing training or following commands<br />-it's great for the price<br /><br />Cons:<br />-it's obviously not ment to keep your dog buys by him/her self for a long time, if you want something challenging go for the $40 games. (I don't find it to be a con, but some people will)"
Ridiculously fun for my dog!,,"My dog loves this toy! She will actually go to the shelf where we store it and bark until we give it to her. I usually put a variety of treats in it, including peanut butter. It's easy to clean, keeps my dog occupied for hours (provided I keep filling it with treats), and really I don't have anything negative to say about it. I definitely recommend it!"
Kind of Boring,,"This was alright. My dog destroyed the tennis balls on the rope in about ten minutes. The frisbee is very fun. The three games are ok, just kind of boring. I guess it could be fun for a puppy or an older dog, but my dog only took about 3 seconds to find the treats."
Horrible quality,,"The tug-a-war toy and the frisbee disk look like they are nice online, when they arrive they are terribly made. The tennis balls fall apart almost immediately and have a strong toxic smell to them. My dog is only a medium size dog and he had the rubber pulled off of the frisbee disk in a matter of seconds christmas day. We could not give him either toy back in fear of him choking on the pieces that were coming off. The game has held up so far. it is made of plastic and we always supervise him playing with him. We will see how that goes. If you don't mind paying the amount for just the game and throwing away the other two toys than it's not a big deal. I was just disappointed in the quality. There are better brand name games out there for your dog."
Good one!,,This is a nice puzzle. You have three games in one. So your dog does'nt get to bored with one type. The only thing about this one is the plastic seems thin so I shall see how long it lasts without breaking.
Healthy and yummy,,This is a great healthy snack for kids.  My 10 year old loves them.
No bad,,"I have a finicky puppy. That's right, puppy, not kitten. I know this is hard to believe.  After all, dogs are to food as, well, dogs are to food.  Except mine. Oscar has tried a number of different foods -- all top of the line.  And while he initially seems to like them, his early enthusiasm fades quickly.  We're still giving Halo a chance -- sort of a last effort before adding canned food to the mix, something we desperate want to avoid.  So far, so good.  Certainly worth a try for those starting out and those contemplating a switch."
Good,,Fast shipping!! I only take 1 bag a day. I sleep so well at night^^  i need to get mor for my friend also.
An exotic delight,,"I recently went to dinner at a Moroccan restaurant and has the most delicious fruit salad there.  What made the dish so special was the combination of orange blossom water and mint that the fruit pieces were stewed in.  I bought this product to recreate the dish, and love it.  I also put it in a combination of espresso and hot milk, along with cardamom, to make an authentic north African-style coffee and it is far better than anything you can buy in a fancy cafe.  Granted, orange blossom water is and acquired taste, and I would not recommend tasting it by itself.  It is much better served in small portions, mixed with fruits, nuts, coffees, teas, and pastries.  A superb product!"
Noirot Orange Flower water,,I used this in Baklava.  Smells good and the Baklava tasted great.<br />Great seller.  Packed well and shipped fast.
